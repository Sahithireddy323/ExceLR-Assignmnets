    "# Interview Questions:\n",
    "# 1. What is lift and why is it important in Association rules?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lift measures the ratio of the observed support of a rule to the expected support if the antecedent and consequent were independent.  \n",
    "# Lift > 1 implies that the items are more likely to be bought together than if they were independent. \n",
    "# Lift < 1 implies that the items are less likely to be bought together than if they were independent.\n",
    "# Lift = 1 indicates that the items are independent.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Importance:  Lift helps to identify the truly interesting rules, filtering out those that might occur simply due to high support for individual items.  A high lift value suggests a strong association between the antecedent and the consequent that is not explainable by chance alone.  It's crucial for focusing on the most impactful relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What is support and Confidence. How do you calculate them?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Support: The support of an itemset (or rule) is the proportion of transactions in the dataset that contain that itemset.\n",
    "#    Calculation:  (Number of transactions containing the itemset) / (Total number of transactions)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Confidence: The confidence of a rule (X => Y) is the conditional probability that a transaction containing X will also contain Y.\n",
    "#    Calculation: (Support of the itemset X âˆª Y) / (Support of the itemset X)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Let's say we have 1000 transactions, and in 100 of those transactions, both item A and item B are present.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Support(A âˆª B) = 100/1000 = 0.1\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Now, suppose that item A appears in 200 transactions.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Support(A) = 200/1000 = 0.2\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Then the confidence of the rule A => B is:\n",
    "# Confidence(A => B) = Support(A âˆª B) / Support(A) = 0.1 / 0.2 = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What are some limitations or challenges of Association rules mining?\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Data sparsity: Large datasets often have sparse itemsets, leading to infrequent item combinations. This results in a vast search space and can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  High dimensionality: Datasets with many items can lead to a very high number of possible rules. This can overwhelm the system with irrelevant rules, increasing computation time and making the results difficult to analyze.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  Minimum support and confidence thresholds: Setting appropriate thresholds for support and confidence is crucial for identifying meaningful rules. An inappropriate choice of thresholds might result in missing important patterns or discovering noisy and irrelevant relationships.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  Scalability issues: Association rule mining can be computationally intensive, particularly for large datasets. This limits its scalability and the size of problems it can handle effectively.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  Handling categorical and numerical data: Association rule mining is typically designed to handle categorical data. Special pre-processing is needed for numerical data before applying the algorithms.  Binning or other techniques need to be applied carefully.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  Lack of interpretability:  While lift and confidence give information, it's still difficult to directly relate the discovered rules to specific causal relationships.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  Inherent biases:  The data may contain inherent biases which may influence the identified patterns."
